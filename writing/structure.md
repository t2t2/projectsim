# Introduction

*Context explanation:*

* Problem with software projects (going over time/budget)
* Why simulation game (compare with flight simulators?)
* Previous implementations
  * "Design and Implementation of a Scenario for Simulation-based Learning in the Domain of Software-Engineering" (proper reference?)


# Model

*Contains an overview for the created model.*

## Model Overview

*Explains what is happening in the model as it is being simulated.*

## Model Entities

*Explanations of objects used in the model (eg. Worker, Manager, User story, Task)*

### User Story

(Requirement that the project must complete. Composes of tasks)

### Task

(A task that must be completed by a worker as part of implementing the user story)

### Worker

(Employee who completes tasks)

### Manager

(The in-game representation of the player?)

## Model variables

*Explanation of the variables in the model that can be changed to modify the output*

# Application

*Explains the complete side of the project: Implementation of the project and the game.*

## Libraries

*Explanations of which frameworks and libraries are used in the project: How they are used and why they are used.*

### Sim.JS

(Used for constructing the simulation model)

### Lo-Dash

(Used for utility functions while ensuring cross-browser (and environment) support)

### jQuery

(Used for front-end code)

### Mustache

(Used for rendering templates on the front-end)

### Bootstrap

(Front-end looks, mainly because I'm not good at design and every new site seems to use it)

### RequireJS

(Used for modular loading of the code)

(Also used RequireJS text module for template loading)

### Grunt

(Build tool, used for a simple development server and compressing the code that is ready to be served)

## Structure

*Explanation on how the code is structured, how the model is represented in the code, how the game UI interfaces with it, etc...*

# Game

## User Story

*Overview of the game from the player's perspective.*

## Random Events

*List of random events that the player needs to decide on, explanations of what decisions change.*


# Conclusions

*Something something how great it is?*

*For possible future expansions:*

* Tracking player's choices
* Online leaderboards to find out best decisions.
